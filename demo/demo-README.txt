Open Demo.asc in LTspice and run. There are multiple steps and measurements 
in the simulation file.

If you have you log files set to be in you temp folder you can run the exe 
from anywhere. Else you need to run it from the same directory as the exe.

A file similar to Demo_2015-08-16_20-07-42.xlsx should appear in the same 
directory with each step and the measured data in a spreadsheet.
